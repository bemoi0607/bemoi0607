## Hi there Im Sangbeom👋 
I'm a full-stack product developer and the technical founder of Loqu —  
a language exchange platform designed to connect real people through meaningful conversation,  
with AI assisting silently in the background when needed.

---

## 🛠 How I built Loqu

Loqu is built as a fully serverless, cross-platform application using:

- **Frontend**: React Native (with Expo) for mobile and web, and Next.js for admin & landing pages  
- **Backend**: AWS Amplify, AppSync (GraphQL), CDK, Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3  
- **LLM Integration**: Custom TypeScript SDK wrapping OpenAI’s GPT models (GPT-4o)  
- **UI/UX**: Gluestack UI, Storybook, and a strong focus on UX flows tailored for language learners  
- **Tooling & Infra**: Docker, Devcontainers, Jest, Cypress, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD

💬 Ask me about anything related to serverless architecture, full-stack TypeScript, LLM integration, or cross-platform app development with Expo and React Native.


## Things I've worked on

• Designed and deployed a premium AI writing assistant to enhance sentence clarity and tone, powered by GPT models and AWS Lambda<br>
• Built a scalable thread-based feed and real-time chat infrastructure using AWS AppSync and GraphQL<br>
• Set up full CI/CD pipelines with automated deployment to App Store and Play Store<br>
• Developed an advanced multilingual language detection system using LLMs and AWS services<br>
• Created UX flows that guide users to write in their learning language first, then follow with their native language for reflection and clarity

## 🌱 What I'm learning & exploring

• I'm really into building scalable, reliable systems — figuring out how to make things fast, stable, and easy to maintain over time.  
• Recently, I've been having a lot of fun experimenting with LLMs. There's something exciting about blending AI with human-centered features in thoughtful ways.  
• I’ve also been digging deeper into UX — trying to understand how small interaction patterns can make a big difference in how people use the product.

If you’re into similar things — scalable systems, AI, or product design — I’d love to chat.

## 🏃‍♂️ Outside of work

Lately, I’ve been really into boxing — I start most mornings with a few rounds at the gym.  
I’ve always loved staying active, and I’m also into weight training and playing basketball when I get the chance.
