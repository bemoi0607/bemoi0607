## Things I've worked on

• Designed and deployed a premium AI writing assistant to enhance sentence clarity and tone, powered by GPT models and AWS Lambda<br>
• Built a scalable thread-based feed and real-time chat infrastructure using AWS AppSync and GraphQL<br>
• Set up full CI/CD pipelines with automated deployment to App Store and Play Store<br>
• Developed an advanced multilingual language detection system using LLMs and AWS services<br>
• Created UX flows that guide users to write in their learning language first, then follow with their native language for reflection and clarity

## 🌱 What I'm learning lately

• I'm really into building scalable, reliable systems — figuring out how to make things fast, stable, and easy to maintain over time.

• Recently, I've been having a lot of fun experimenting with LLMs. There's something exciting about blending AI with human-centered features in thoughtful ways.

• I’ve also been digging deeper into UX — trying to understand how small interaction patterns can make a big difference in how people use the product.
